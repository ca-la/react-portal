# React Portal

This library provides the ability to render children into a node that can exist outside the direct hierarchy of the parent component. [React's Portal](https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html) is specifically tied to the DOM, meaning that React applications that need to portal children to a non-DOM based location are out of luck. These cases range from applications built with [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) to interfacing with [WebGL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API).
